# Abandon normal instruments

- Watch them move before you attach the markers
- What does the sound of their footsteps tell you?
- The mirror was the first motion capture system
- Ask them to describe where they feel it - proprioception is a sensor

# Accept advice

- The physical therapist's hands know something the force plate doesn't
- The patient has been debugging this system for years
- What do athletes and dancers do that clinicians ignore?
- Ask the prosthetist who's fitted a thousand legs

# Accretion

- The body adapted to injury over months - your intervention can too
- Add one degree of freedom. Observe. Repeat.
- Rehabilitation is already accretion - work with it, not against it
- Log the compensations before you correct them

# A line has two sides

- The limp is a problem and a solution
- Your exoskeleton assists some muscles by burdening others
- Stiffness protects and restricts
- The injury revealed a movement pattern the healthy gait hid

# Allow an easement

- Symmetry is an aesthetic, not a requirement
- "Normal gait" is a statistical fiction - what does this person need?
- Which clinical threshold exists for billing codes, not bodies?
- Let them move wrong if it doesn't hurt

# Are there sections? Consider transitions

- Stance to swing. The transition is where control happens
- Where does the spine end and the hip begin? The body doesn't draw that line where you do
- The loading phase, the propulsion phase, the recovery. What happens between them?
- The boundary between voluntary and reflexive control — can you find it in the kinematics?

# Ask people to work against their better judgment

- Ask the subject to walk in a way that feels wrong. Record what changes
- Design the prosthetic joint to allow the movement the surgeon wants to prevent
- Increase the load when the protocol says reduce it. Where does compensation appear?
- Challenge the idea that bilateral symmetry is the goal

# Ask your body

- Perform the movement yourself before you model it
- Tape your knee. Walk. Now you know what constrained motion feels like
- Carry a weight on one side for an hour. The compensation you feel is the one your subject has permanently
- Close your eyes and stand on one foot. The proprioceptive strategy you use is data

# Assemble some of the instruments in a group and treat the group

- The foot, the ankle, and the shoe are one system. Don't separate them
- EMG, kinematics, and kinetics together. Not three datasets — one movement
- The pelvis, the trunk, and the head stabilize together. Analyze the unit, not the segments
- The crutch is part of the musculoskeletal system while the patient uses it

# Balance the consistency principle with the inconsistency principle

- Healthy gait is variable. Pathological gait is stereotyped. Variability might be the metric
- Some trials should be controlled, some ecological. Mix them intentionally
- The motor system balances consistency of outcome with variability of execution. Study the variability, not just the mean
- Standardize the task but let the strategy be free

# Be dirty

- Let them wear their own shoes. The lab shoe is a confound, not a control
- Collect data in the hallway, not the gait lab. Real walking happens on real floors
- The noisy EMG signal includes crosstalk. The crosstalk is co-activation data
- Stop filtering the force plate signal so aggressively. The high-frequency content is impact

# Breathe more deeply

- Record a thousand strides, not ten. The statistics of natural variability need volume
- Measure the whole body, not just the joint you're interested in
- Extend the trial beyond fatigue. The post-fatigue strategy is the one that causes injury
- What does this movement look like over a year of rehabilitation, not one lab visit?

# Bridges -build -burn

- Connect the biomechanist to the neurologist. The motor command is the bridge between them
- Tissue mechanics and whole-body dynamics are the same system at different scales. Build the link
- Burn the bridge between "clinical" and "sports" biomechanics. The problems are the same
- The gap between simulation and measurement is where the model is wrong. That gap is the research

# Cascades

- The ankle dorsiflexion deficit cascades into knee hyperextension into hip flexion into lumbar lordosis. Trace the chain
- A shoe insert changes the ground reaction force changes the joint moment changes the muscle activation. Follow it up
- One fall cascades into fear of falling into reduced mobility into deconditioning into the next fall
- Impact at the heel propagates through the skeleton. Where does it attenuate? Where does it amplify?

# Change instrument roles

- The force plate measures ground reaction force. But it also measures balance, cadence, and weight-shifting strategy
- The motion capture system tracks markers. Use it to track deformation instead
- The treadmill isn't just a walking surface — it's a perturbation device. Change its speed mid-stride
- The EMG electrodes measure muscle activity. But the timing pattern is a motor control signal, not a biomechanics one

# Change nothing and continue with immaculate consistency

- Same subject, same shoes, same time of day, same warm-up. Now the variability you see is biological
- Don't upgrade the software between data collection phases. Comparability costs
- Run the same protocol your predecessor used. The twenty-year longitudinal comparison is worth more than the optimized new method
- Keep the marker placement identical across visits. One millimeter of drift compounds over a gait cycle

# Children's voices -speaking -singing

- How would a child describe this movement? "He walks like he's on a boat" — that's a vestibular observation
- What does the toddler do that the adult has optimized away? The inefficient strategy reveals the options
- A child learning to walk is exploring the solution space your model already constrained
- Ask the patient's child what looks different about how mom moves. They notice

# Cluster analysis

- Your patient population has three different compensation strategies. Stop averaging across them
- Cluster the gait cycles by shape, not by diagnosis. What groups emerge?
- The joint angle trajectories have natural families. PCA will show you the modes. What do they mean?
- Which movements does the subject group together that you separate? Their motor plan clusters differently than your anatomy

# Consider different fading systems

- How does performance degrade as fatigue accumulates? Map the decline curve, not just the endpoint
- The aging gait pattern is the healthy pattern fading. What fades first?
- As the anesthetic wears off, which motor functions return in what order? The sequence is the hierarchy
- The prosthetic user's compensations increase over the day. The fade reveals what the device fails to provide

# Consult other sources -promising -unpromising

- Read the robotics literature. They solved the walking stability problem differently
- The unpromising source: the cobbler, the shoe-fitter, the orthotics technician
- What do animators know about making movement look natural that biomechanists don't formalize?
- Veterinary biomechanics. Quadrupeds solved the redundancy problem with a different architecture

# Convert a melodic element into a rhythmic element

- Stop measuring the amplitude of the movement. Measure the timing
- The joint angle curve is a shape. Convert it to a rhythm — when does each peak occur?
- Cadence, not speed. Step timing, not step length. The temporal pattern is the neural signature
- Turn the continuous force plate signal into a series of events: heel strike, loading peak, push-off

# Courage!

- Report the data that contradicts the clinical guideline
- Tell the surgeon their procedure changes the biomechanics for the worse. Show them
- Publish the gait analysis that shows the expensive intervention didn't help
- Your simulated result predicts the implant will fail. Say so

# Cut a vital connection

- Sever the biarticular muscle in the model. What movement becomes impossible?
- Remove the plantar fascia from your foot model. What happens to the arch?
- Disconnect the vestibular input in your balance model. What compensates?
- What happens to gait when you eliminate hip abductor function? The compensation is the experiment

# Decorate, decorate

- Add IMU data to every motion capture session. You might need the accelerations later
- Record video alongside the instrumented data. The eye sees what the markers miss
- Measure skin temperature over the prosthetic interface. Pressure is only half the comfort story
- Collect subjective pain scores at every time point. The body's report card alongside the machine's

# Define an area as 'safe' and use it as an anchor

- Standing still is your baseline. Fully characterized quiet stance is the anchor for everything dynamic
- The mid-stance phase is the most stable part of gait. Anchor your analysis there
- The healthy limb is the control for the affected limb. But verify — the "healthy" limb has already adapted
- One well-calibrated force plate in the center of the lab. Everything else is referenced to it

# Destroy -nothing -the most important thing

- Remove the knee joint from the model. What can the body still do?
- Destroy nothing: the failed prosthetic design still teaches you what loads the interface can't handle
- What movement survives the loss of the most important muscle? That's the redundancy architecture
- Delete the ground from the simulation. What does the controller do in free fall?

# Discard an axiom

- What if rigid body mechanics doesn't apply to this segment? Bone flexes. Soft tissue deforms
- What if the joint center isn't a fixed point? It migrates during the movement
- Drop the assumption that muscle force is proportional to EMG amplitude
- What if the body isn't minimizing energy? What if it's minimizing pain, or maximizing stability, or something you haven't named?

# Disconnect from desire

- You want the new orthotic to work. What does the force data actually show?
- You want the model to match the experimental data. Where it doesn't match is where you learn
- Stop wanting the beautiful symmetric gait. The asymmetric one might be optimal for this body
- You're attached to the inverse dynamics approach. But the body doesn't compute inverse dynamics. What does it compute?

# Discover the recipes you are using and abandon them

- You always filter at 6 Hz. You always use a fourth-order Butterworth. Why?
- You always normalize to body weight and height. What if the normalization is hiding the effect?
- Your marker set is from 1990. The conventions have calcified into assumptions
- You always start with sagittal plane analysis. The frontal and transverse planes are waiting

# Distorting time

- Play the motion capture back at half speed. What do you see that real-time hides?
- Record at 1000 Hz instead of 100 Hz. The impact transient lives in the high-speed data
- What if you analyzed the movement backwards, from foot-off to heel-strike? The deceleration strategy appears
- Compress a year of rehabilitation into a single animation. The trajectory of recovery has a shape

# Do nothing for as long as possible

- Don't cue the movement. Let the subject decide when to start. The initiation is motor planning data
- Don't intervene in the compensation. Observe it for six months. It might resolve on its own
- The quiet standing trial should be five minutes, not thirty seconds. Postural drift is the signal
- Watch ten minutes of natural movement before you instruct a single task

# Don't be afraid of things because they're easy to do

- Goniometry is easy. It's also fast, cheap, and sufficient for the clinical question
- Counting steps is trivial. Over a week, it's a mobility metric
- Observation — just watching someone walk — is still the first and most powerful tool
- A stopwatch and a ten-meter walkway answer most gait speed questions

# Don't be frightened of cliches

- The inverted pendulum model of walking is a cliche because it captures something real
- Joint angles, joint moments, joint powers. The standard gait report is standard for a reason
- "Form follows function" is a cliche in biomechanics. It's also the central hypothesis
- The free body diagram is introductory physics. It's also correct

# Don't be frightened to display your talents

- You can spot the hip hike from across the room. That pattern recognition is years of expertise
- Your intuition about which movement is painful is diagnostic skill. Formalize it
- You build physical models from dowels and rubber bands. That hands-on thinking finds things the computer misses
- You understand the math behind the musculoskeletal model better than the software does. Use it directly

# Don't break the silence

- The static trial is the silence before the movement. Don't rush through it
- Between trials, the subject rests. What happens during the rest is recovery strategy
- Not every stride needs to be a data collection stride. Let them walk normally between measurements
- The quiet period after a perturbation — the return to baseline — is the stability measurement

# Don't stress one thing more than another

- You focus on the knee because that's where the pain is. But the hip and ankle are creating the load
- Sagittal plane gets all the attention. The transverse plane rotation might be the cause
- The peak force matters. But the loading rate matters too, and the impulse, and the duration
- You study the joint. The tendon, the ligament, the cartilage — each bears load differently

# Do something boring

- Digitize the old film records. Nobody has done it and the data is irreplaceable
- Validate your model against the benchmark dataset. All six movements, not just walking
- Calibrate the force plates. Check the crosstalk matrix. Replace the worn treadmill belt
- Re-read the Winter textbook. The fundamentals haven't changed. Your understanding of them has

# Do the washing up

- Clean the markers. Replace the adhesive. Check the battery levels on the EMG transmitters
- Update the calibration files. The lab temperature shifted and the cameras drifted
- Organize the trial data from last year's collection. Half the files are mislabeled
- Tighten every bolt on the motion capture frame. One loose mount adds noise to every trial

# Do the words need changing?

- "Abnormal gait" — abnormal relative to what population, measured how?
- You say "instability." The patient says "it gives way." These might be different phenomena
- Is it "muscle weakness" or "inadequate motor recruitment"? The intervention differs
- "Heel strike" — many pathological gaits don't strike with the heel. Call it "initial contact"

# Do we need holes?

- Your rigid body model has no soft tissue. Do you need it, or is the gap acceptable?
- The gap between surface EMG and actual muscle force. Can you live with the inference, or do you need intramuscular?
- Your model has no ligaments. Does the passive constraint matter for this movement?
- The hole in your dataset where the markers were occluded — interpolate it or study why it was occluded

# Emphasize differences

- Left leg versus right leg. The asymmetry is the clinical story
- The first stride and the hundredth stride. What changed?
- The same task on flat ground versus on a slope. The difference reveals the control strategy
- Two patients with the same diagnosis but different compensation patterns. The difference is the subtype

# Emphasize repetitions

- The movement pattern that appears in walking, stair climbing, and sit-to-stand. That's the constraint
- The same compensation appears in every patient with this injury. It's not individual — it's structural
- The subject repeats the same error on every trial. That's not noise, it's their solution
- The cyclical nature of gait is itself the data. The repetition creates the signal

# Emphasize the flaws

- The trial where they stumbled. The recovery strategy is more interesting than the steady state
- The prosthetic socket that causes pain at hour six. The failure mode is the design constraint
- Your model diverges at high speeds. The divergence tells you what physics you're missing
- The marker that keeps falling off is on the segment with the most soft tissue motion. That's a measurement, not a nuisance

# Faced with a choice, do both

- Kinematics or kinetics? Collect both. The inverse dynamics needs them together anyway
- Lab or field? Instrument both environments and compare
- 2D or 3D? Run the 2D analysis — if it suffices, the 3D was unnecessary. If it doesn't, you know why
- Treadmill or overground? The difference between them is itself a finding

# Feedback recordings into an acoustic situation

- Show the subject their own motion capture in real time. The biofeedback changes the movement
- Play back the force plate signal as sound. The auditory feedback retrains gait timing
- Project the pressure map under the patient's feet as they walk. Let them respond to their own data
- Record today's gait and overlay it on last month's gait. Show the patient the change

# Fill every beat with something

- If the subject is in the lab, collect every movement you can. Standing, walking, stairs, reaching, turning
- Every stride is a data point. Don't discard the ones between the force plates
- Instrument the warm-up. The transition from casual to instructed movement is a cognitive shift
- Collect both legs even when only one is affected. You'll need the comparison

# Get your neck massaged

- You've been processing gait data for twelve hours. The error you can't find is probably in the coordinate system definition
- Step away from the model. Watch someone walk outside the lab window
- Switch from the computer to the workshop. Build something with your hands
- Talk to the clinician about the patient, not the data. Remember the person inside the kinematics

# Ghost echoes

- The ACL was repaired five years ago. The compensation pattern persists. The ghost of the injury is in the motor plan
- The child wore leg braces. The adult walks as if they're still there
- The phantom limb moves. The motor cortex remembers a body that no longer exists
- The old shoe was worn on one side. The new shoe is symmetrical but the gait isn't — it remembers the old shoe

# Give the game away

- Publish your marker set, your filtering parameters, your normalization method. Let others replicate exactly
- Share the raw C3D files, not just the processed curves
- Make your musculoskeletal model openly available. The field needs shared tools, not proprietary ones
- Tell the competing lab your approach. The collaboration is worth more than the scoop

# Give way to your worst impulse

- Let the subject run at maximum speed in the lab. Yes, they might fall. Catch them. But the maximum effort is the stress test
- Apply a perturbation large enough to make them step. The protective response is the reflex architecture
- Load the bone model until it fails. The failure mode is the injury mechanism
- Ask the subject to do the movement that hurts. The pain-avoidance strategy is the data

# Go slowly all the way round the outside

- Before you study the knee, understand the forces arriving from the foot and descending from the hip
- Map the entire kinetic chain before you zoom into one joint
- Walk around the subject. Observe from anterior, posterior, lateral, superior. Each view reveals different asymmetries
- Understand the environment — the floor surface, the incline, the footwear — before you study the body on it

# Honor thy error as a hidden intention

- The marker placement was wrong. But the "wrong" location tracked the soft tissue motion you actually wanted
- The subject misunderstood the instruction and did a different movement. That movement is now in your dataset. Analyze it
- The force plate was mis-zeroed. The offset reveals how much the subject actually weighs on that limb
- The model produced negative muscle forces. That's not an error — that's passive tissue mechanics you forgot to include

# How would you have done it?

- Before motion capture existed, how did clinicians assess gait? They watched. What did they see that you've stopped seeing?
- How would you measure this force without a force plate?
- If you had to design the prosthetic with only hand tools and plaster, what shape would it be?
- How did Borelli analyze movement in 1680? What did he get right with geometry alone?

# Humanize something free of error

- The simulation walks perfectly. Nobody walks perfectly. What's missing from the cost function?
- Your optimal control solution produces inhuman movement. The human solution is suboptimal but robust
- The finite element model predicts stress with high precision. But the patient feels pain in a different location. Listen to the patient
- The prosthetic is biomechanically optimal and the user hates wearing it. Comfort is a variable you didn't model

# Imagine the music as a moving chain or caterpillar

- The body is a kinetic chain. Force flows through it like a wave. Follow the wave
- The spine undulates during gait. The segments move in sequence, not simultaneously
- Watch the whole body during a throw. The hip, trunk, shoulder, elbow, wrist — a whip-like sequence. The timing is everything
- The COM trajectory is a smooth curve moving through space. The limbs serve it. Start with the center, not the segments

# Imagine the music as a set of disconnected events

- What if the hip and the ankle aren't coordinated? What if each joint solves its own problem locally?
- Treat each heel strike as an independent impact event. What varies between them?
- Separate the stance phase into discrete sub-events: loading, midstance, push-off. Analyze each alone
- Your assumption of coupling might be wrong. Test whether the joint movements are actually correlated

# Infinitesimal gradations

- Tilt the surface by one degree. Then two. Then three. Where does the compensation strategy change?
- The difference between a walk and a run isn't a switch — there's a continuum. Where in that continuum are you measuring?
- Increase the load by the smallest increment that produces a detectable change. That's the sensitivity of the system
- The difference between a healthy and a pathological angle might be five degrees. Your measurement error is three. Can you resolve it?

# Intentions -credibility of -nobility of -humility of

- Are you studying this to help the patient or to validate the model? Both are fine, but the experiment differs
- Your paper says "clinical application." Your method requires a $500K lab. Be honest about the gap
- Humility: the body has been solving this mechanics problem for millions of years. Your model is a sketch
- The intention to improve the prosthetic is noble. But the user's lived experience of it is the measure of success, not your simulation

# Into the impossible

- Try to predict the exact moment someone will fall. The failure to predict reveals what's stochastic
- Attempt to reconstruct internal joint forces from skin-mounted markers alone. Push the inverse problem as far as it can go
- Design a passive device that produces powered-ankle push-off. The constraint breeds invention
- Build a model that captures both the bone mechanics and the tissue fluid dynamics. The impossible integration reveals what each field ignores about the other

# Is it finished?

- You've collected enough gait cycles to characterize this patient. Stop collecting and start interpreting
- The model has been in development for three years. At some point it needs to answer a question
- Your prosthetic prototype works well enough to test with users. Stop optimizing in CAD and start fitting
- The rehabilitation protocol has been running for twelve weeks. Measure the outcome. The answer is ready whether you like it or not

# Is there something missing?

- Your gait model has no arms. The arm swing contributes to balance and efficiency
- You measured the kinematics but not the ground reaction force. Half the picture is missing
- There's no pain variable in your model. The body optimizes around pain. You're ignoring the cost function
- Your analysis has no context: what were they carrying, what were they wearing, how far had they already walked?

# Is the tuning appropriate?

- Your low-pass filter is removing the impact transient. That's the signal, not the noise
- The treadmill speed was self-selected. But is self-selected speed the same as natural speed? The lab changes behavior
- Your marker sampling rate is adequate for walking. Is it adequate for running? For landing?
- The force plate threshold is set too high. You're missing the quiet phases of ground contact

# Just carry on

- The gait pattern hasn't changed after six weeks of therapy. Keep going. Motor learning is slow
- Your model doesn't converge for this movement. Add more iterations before you change the approach
- The subject is tired. But fatigue data is the data you need. Keep collecting
- The results are inconclusive at n=15. Recruit more subjects. The effect might be small but real

# Left channel, right channel, center channel

- Left limb, right limb, center of mass. Three trajectories, three stories
- Medial compartment, lateral compartment, patellofemoral. Three loads in the same knee
- Anterior muscles, posterior muscles, the joint between them. Agonist, antagonist, fulcrum
- Skin surface, muscle belly, bone. Three depths, three mechanical environments

# Listen in total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly

- Turn off the visual display. Listen to the footfall pattern. Can you hear the asymmetry?
- Remove all the markers and just watch the movement in dim light. The silhouette shows the pattern
- Measure only the ground reaction force with no kinematics. What can force alone tell you?
- Close the lab report. Watch the video with fresh eyes. What do you see before you analyze?

# Listen to the quiet voice

- The smallest muscle in the chain might be the stabilizer that prevents the injury
- The low-amplitude vibration in the force plate data. It's muscle tremor. That's fatigue
- The slight pelvic obliquity that doesn't reach clinical threshold. It's driving the compensation pattern anyway
- The patient says "it feels weird." That's a proprioceptive signal the instruments don't capture

# Look at a very small object; look at its center

- One joint. One plane. One phase of gait. Understand it completely
- The contact patch between the shoe and the floor. What shape is it? How does it migrate?
- One motor unit. Its firing pattern during the movement. That's the neural control in miniature
- The center of pressure. Its trajectory tells you everything about balance strategy without a single marker

# Look at the order in which you do things

- You always analyze the ankle first because it's closest to the ground. Start at the hip
- You collect data, then process, then analyze, then interpret. What if you interpreted first — from observation — then checked?
- You design the prosthetic, then test it. What if you tested the socket interface before you designed the joint?
- You warm up the subject with walking. What if you started with the hardest task and let them figure it out?

# Look closely at the most embarrassing details and amplify them

- Your model predicts co-contraction that shouldn't exist. Maybe it does exist and you're embarrassed by the model being more honest than your expectations
- The subject couldn't complete the task. The failure is the functional ceiling. Report it
- Your force plate data has a drift. Quantify the drift. It's been in every dataset you've published
- The prosthetic user rejected your device. Why? That rejection is more informative than the user who accepted it

# Lowest common denominator check -single beat -single note -single riff

- Can the patient stand? That's the first question. Everything else builds on it
- One stride. What can you learn from a single gait cycle?
- Does the joint move? In which direction? That's goniometry. Start there
- Apply a single known force. Does the model produce the correct displacement? That's your validation

# Make a blank valuable by putting it in an exquisite frame

- The joint angle was normal. With proper reporting of the methodology and population norms, that absence of abnormality is clinically valuable
- No difference between conditions. With sufficient power and effect size analysis, that null finding constrains the field's models
- The prosthetic produced no improvement in gait symmetry. With a rigorous study design, that's a publication
- Healthy normative data, carefully collected, is the frame that makes every future pathological finding interpretable

# Make an exhaustive list of everything you might do and do the last thing on the list

- The last thing on the list: measure the movement you think is irrelevant. Jaw position during gait. Breathing pattern during lifting
- You'd never study fidgeting. But micro-movements during "quiet" standing are postural control
- The experiment you'd try only as a last resort — measuring in the patient's home instead of the lab — might be the most valid
- Study the transition from lying to sitting. It's unglamorous and undertreated and affects every patient every morning

# Make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action; incorporate

- Pull the treadmill belt to a sudden stop. The stumble recovery is the motor control experiment
- Drop the handrail out from under the patient's grip. What catches them?
- Apply a sudden lateral push during walking. The corrective step reveals the stability margin
- Release a suddenly held load. The rebound movement shows the anti-gravity strategy

# Mechanicalize something idiosyncratic

- The experienced clinician eyeballs the gait deviation. Decompose that eyeball into measured angles, timing, and symmetry ratios
- The prosthetist adjusts the alignment by feel. Instrument their hands. What forces are they sensing?
- The athlete "just knows" when the movement feels right. Define "right" in mechanical terms
- You can feel the crepitus through the skin. What vibration frequency is that? Can you detect it with an accelerometer?

# Mute and continue

- Eliminate the ankle joint from the model. Lock it. What does the rest of the body do to compensate?
- Turn off one muscle group in the simulation. The remaining muscles redistribute the load
- Remove the visual feedback. Does the balance strategy change without vision?
- Silence the auditory feedback of footsteps. Does gait timing become more variable?

# Only one element of each kind

- One joint, one plane, one subject, one speed. What can you learn from this minimal experiment?
- Isolate one muscle in the model. What movement does it produce alone?
- Study only the stance phase. Or only the swing. Not both
- One degree of freedom at a time. Lock the others. What's the contribution of each?

# (Organic) machinery

- The body adapts its bone density to load. The structure builds itself from the forces it experiences
- Muscle architecture remodels in response to use. The machine redesigns itself
- Fascia connects muscles into slings and chains. The body is not discrete actuators — it's a tensile network
- The growth plate responds to mechanical loading. The child's skeleton is shaped by how they move

# Overtly resist change

- Keep using the Helen Hayes marker set. It's old and limited and comparable to thirty years of literature
- Don't switch to IMUs just because they're new. The camera-based system has known error characteristics
- The 2D analysis is fine for this sagittal-plane question. Resist the pressure to go 3D for everything
- The old wooden prosthetic foot concept is simple and works in low-resource settings. Don't abandon it for carbon fiber

# Put in earplugs

- Ignore the conference trends. Your research question is still valid
- Stop watching the competitor lab's publications and focus on your own data
- Don't let the funding agency's priorities determine what you study. The important question is the important question
- Collect your data without looking at anyone else's results first. Your observation should be uncontaminated

# Remember those quiet evenings

- The first time you watched someone walk in a gait lab and saw the curves appear in real time. The wonder
- Before all the software, you drew stick figures from film frame by frame. There was understanding in that slowness
- The Muybridge photographs. The Marey chronophotographs. Movement science began with observation and curiosity
- When you started, you wanted to help people move better. Is that still what you're doing?

# Remove ambiguities and convert to specifics

- "The patient walks slowly" — how slowly? What speed, measured where, compared to what norm?
- "The knee is unstable" — in which plane, under what load, at what angle of flexion?
- "The gait is antalgic" — which phase is shortened, by how much, on which side?
- Replace "reduced range of motion" with the measured range in degrees, the joint, and the plane

# Remove specifics and convert to ambiguities

- Forget the exact joint angles. What's the movement strategy? Is it a hip strategy or an ankle strategy?
- Don't report the peak force. Report whether the body is loading or unloading
- Zoom out from the individual muscles to the functional groups: extensors, flexors, stabilizers
- Stop thinking about degrees and Newtons. Think about effort, control, and purpose

# Repetition is a form of change

- The thousandth gait cycle is different from the first. The difference is fatigue, adaptation, or learning
- Every stride is a repetition but also a recalibration. The variability between cycles is the motor control
- Repeated loading changes the tissue. The same force applied a million times is a different experiment than one application
- You've studied this joint for twenty years. Your understanding of the same dataset has changed. Revisit it

# Reverse

- Start the analysis at push-off and work backwards. What configuration was the body setting up?
- Instead of asking how force is produced, ask how force is absorbed
- Run the simulation backwards. Does the landing produce a jump?
- Instead of studying how people fall, study how people almost fall and recover. The save is the data

# Short circuit

- Skip the musculoskeletal model. Go directly from kinematics to clinical interpretation. What do you lose?
- Skip the inverse dynamics. Can joint angles alone predict the outcome?
- Don't compute muscle forces. The joint moment is enough for this question
- Remove the preprocessing. What does the raw signal tell you before you filter it?

# Shut the door and listen from outside

- Show the gait data to a clinician who hasn't seen the patient walk. What do they conclude from numbers alone?
- Give the motion capture to someone outside biomechanics. What patterns do they notice?
- Watch the subject walk away from the lab, out the door, down the corridor. That's the movement that matters
- Evaluate the intervention by patient-reported outcome, not by joint angle change

# Simple subtraction

- Remove the shoe. What changes about the ground reaction force?
- Remove one brace component at a time. What was each piece doing?
- Lock one joint in the model. The change in everything else reveals its contribution
- Subtract the healthy limb's kinematics from the affected limb's. The residual is the pathology

# Spectrum analysis

- Frequency-analyze the ground reaction force. The harmonics tell you about rhythm and symmetry
- Decompose the gait cycle into principal components. How many modes explain 95% of the variance?
- Your EMG signal has a frequency spectrum. The median frequency shift is fatigue before force drops
- The vibration spectrum of the bone. Natural frequency changes with density, geometry, and healing status

# Take a break

- The data collection is done. You don't need to process it tonight. Let it rest
- You've been debugging the model for a week. Walk away. Literally walk — it might help you think about walking
- The conference was exhausting. Take a week before you redesign your study based on what you heard
- The patient has been in the lab for two hours. They're fatigued. You're measuring fatigue, not their gait

# Take away the elements in order of apparent non-importance

- Remove the arm swing model. Remove the head motion. Remove the trunk rotation. When does gait prediction collapse?
- Strip the shoe of its cushioning, then its sole stiffness, then its heel counter. Which feature was load-bearing?
- Drop variables from the regression one at a time. The last one standing is the predictor
- Simplify the muscle model: remove tendon dynamics, remove activation dynamics, remove force-velocity. What's the minimum model that walks?

# Tape your mouth

- Show the gait curves without the diagnosis. Let the data speak first
- Present the force plate data without telling the audience which condition is which. Can they tell?
- Don't narrate the video. Play it and wait for questions
- Your interpretation of the compensation pattern is a hypothesis, not a finding. Present the finding alone

# The inconsistency principle

- The same patient walks differently on different days. The inconsistency is the condition, not the noise
- The model works for walking but not for stair climbing. The inconsistency tells you what assumption fails
- Left and right sides never match exactly. The asymmetry is biomechanics, not measurement error
- Two labs measure the same movement and get different numbers. The inter-lab inconsistency is a calibration problem disguised as a biomechanics problem

# The tape is now the music

- The motion capture data is not a representation of the movement. It is the movement, digitized
- The force plate signal isn't a proxy for the ground reaction. It is the ground reaction
- The model isn't trying to be the body. It's a model. Study its behavior as its own object
- The prosthetic isn't a replacement for the limb. It's a new structure with its own biomechanics

# Think of the radio

- The surgeon needs a one-page summary, not a forty-page gait report. Write for them
- The patient needs to understand what's happening in their body. Can you explain the moment curve in plain language?
- The insurance company needs one number. Which number is it?
- The coach needs actionable feedback before the next race. Your analysis must arrive faster than the next training session

# Tidy up

- Standardize your file naming convention across all subjects and sessions
- Clean up the model parameters. Document every assumption. Future you is a different person
- Organize the lab space. A clean calibration volume produces clean data
- Reconcile the clinical notes with the biomechanical data. The patient ID in the file and in the chart should match

# Trust in the you of now

- Your understanding of muscle mechanics is better than it was five years ago. Trust the new intuition
- You've seen enough pathological gait to recognize the pattern before the numbers confirm it. That's skill
- Your sense that the data looks wrong is worth investigating before you process it further
- The model you'd build today would be simpler and better than the one you built three years ago. Build it

# Turn it upside down

- Study the ceiling reaction force on someone doing a handstand. Same mechanics, different orientation
- Instead of studying how the foot loads the ground, study how the ground loads the foot
- Flip the question: not "how does the body produce movement" but "how does the movement constrain the body"
- Study the unloading phase of stance. Everyone studies the loading. The unloading is the preparation for swing

# Twist the spine

- Literally: add thoracic rotation to your gait model. The spine isn't rigid and it changes the kinetic chain
- Shift from sagittal plane to transverse. What does rotation contribute that flexion-extension doesn't explain?
- Move your analysis from the limbs to the trunk. The trunk is the base from which everything hangs
- Study the same joint pathology in the upper limb instead of the lower. Does the body solve the same problem differently?

# Use an old idea

- Murray's normative gait data from 1964. Still cited, still useful, still the baseline nobody has properly replaced
- Spring-mass models of running from the 1980s. Elegant and predictive with two parameters
- The Ranchos Los Amigos gait phases. Descriptive, clinical, and still the language therapists use
- Wolff's law from 1892. Bone adapts to load. The entire field of bone remodeling grew from one observation

# Use an unacceptable color

- Study the movement everyone ignores: getting off the toilet, rolling over in bed, picking something up from the floor
- Use the pathological gait as your primary data and the healthy gait as the deviation from it
- Measure the movement in the population nobody recruits: the very elderly, the very young, the very obese
- Choose the ugliest metric — the one nobody puts in their abstract — if it answers the clinical question

# Use fewer notes

- One joint angle, one plane, one metric. If it separates patients from controls, you don't need thirty variables
- Reduce the marker set to the minimum that captures the question. Six markers might be enough
- One force plate, not six. What can a single contact tell you?
- Degrees of freedom are not free. Each one you add to the model needs justification. Remove one

# Use filters

- Analyze only the steady-state strides. Discard the acceleration and deceleration
- Filter your subject pool to the ten most severe cases. The signal is strongest there
- Look only at the sagittal plane for this question. The other planes are a distraction
- Only examine the stance phase. If the problem is loading, swing is irrelevant

# Use "unqualified" people

- The first-year student sees the gait deviation that you've habituated to
- The engineer from another discipline designs the brace differently because they don't know the conventions
- The patient knows what hurts and when. Their language is diagnostic even without the jargon
- The occupational therapist sees functional movement where the biomechanist sees angles

# Water

- Fluid mechanics in the joint. Synovial fluid is a lubricant and a mechanical element
- The body is 60% water. Tissue deformation is a fluid mechanics problem as much as a solid mechanics one
- Movement in water changes everything: buoyancy, drag, viscosity. Hydrotherapy is a different biomechanical environment
- The intervertebral disc is a hydraulic shock absorber. Its fluid content changes through the day. Morning spine and evening spine are different lengths

# What are you really thinking about just now? Incorporate

- You keep thinking about the patient who fell last week. That case is the research question you should be pursuing
- You're distracted by the material properties of the new prosthetic liner. Follow that thread — the interface mechanics are underserved
- You're thinking about your own knee pain. Your body is telling you what to study
- The crack in the treadmill belt. It's a perturbation that every subject experienced. It's in the data

# What is the reality of the situation?

- Your lab has one force plate and no treadmill. Design the study around what you have
- The patient population is heterogeneous. Your n=20 contains at least four different movement disorders
- The clinical team has fifteen minutes per patient. Your analysis needs to fit that window
- Skin movement artifact is real, present, and not going away. Quantify it instead of pretending it doesn't exist

# What mistakes did you make last time?

- Last time the markers shifted during the dynamic trial. Double-side tape and check with a static mid-trial
- You miscalculated the joint center from the calibration. Use a functional method this time
- The filter cutoff was too aggressive and you smoothed out the heel strike transient
- You reported means without standard deviations. This time, show the variability

# What would your closest friend do?

- Your colleague would say: the model is too complex. Simplify before you debug
- Your mentor would say: go back to the research question. You've drifted
- Your collaborator would say: have you actually looked at the data, or just the processed output?
- The clinician across the hall would say: does any of this change what I do with the patient?

# What wouldn't you do?

- You'd never study someone brushing their teeth. But the shoulder biomechanics of that daily task predict rotator cuff load
- You'd never measure barefoot walking on gravel. But that's how half the world walks
- You'd never build a model with no muscles — just rigid links and gravity. But passive dynamic walkers prove something fundamental
- You'd never let the patient design the study. But their priorities would produce different research

# Work at a different speed

- Record at 10 Hz instead of 100 Hz. What resolution do you actually need for this question?
- Slow the treadmill to 0.5 m/s. Walking at minimum speed reveals different control strategies
- Collect one session per month for a year instead of twelve sessions in one week
- Speed up the analysis: automate the processing and look at a hundred subjects instead of ten

# You are an engineer

- The joint is a bearing. What are the contact pressures, the wear surfaces, the lubrication regime?
- The bone is a structural member. Analyze it with beam theory. Where is the stress concentration?
- The prosthetic is a product. Fatigue life, material selection, manufacturing tolerance — these are the design constraints
- The movement is a control problem. Inputs, outputs, feedback loops, stability margins. Solve it as one

# You can only make one dot at a time

- One subject, one trial, one analysis. Complete it before moving on
- Write up the first patient before you collect the second. What you learn changes your protocol
- One model validation at a time. Don't add complexity until the simple version is verified
- One clinical question per study. The paper that tries to answer three answers none

# You don't have to be ashamed of using your own ideas

- Your clinical hunch about the mechanism of injury — build the experiment around it
- The prosthetic alignment trick you figured out in the workshop. Test it formally
- Your alternative explanation for the compensation pattern. It contradicts the textbook. Test it
- The method you improvised because the equipment broke. It might be better than the standard method

# [blank white card]

- The movement that hasn't been studied is the one your specific patient performs every day
- There is no protocol for this body, this injury, this life. Design one
- The blank card is the permission to ask a question that doesn't fit in any existing framework
- The body is always doing something that biomechanics hasn't named yet. Watch for it
