# Abandon normal instruments

- What did builders know before materials science existed?
- Touch it. Bend it. Smell it. What does the spectrometer miss?
- The organism that made this material didn't characterize it first
- What would a craftsperson measure?

# Accept advice

- Ask the manufacturer why they won't use it
- The regulator's objection contains the real specification
- What do architects and designers know that chemists ignore?
- The anthropologist has watched people live with materials for longer than you

# Accretion

- Nature builds materials by accretion - why do you design all at once?
- What happens if you let it grow instead of synthesize it?
- Add one constraint (cost, scale, regulation) at a time
- The path to deployment is iterative - so should the material be

# A line has two sides

- Biodegradable means temporary and unreliable
- Biomimicry gives you nature's solution to nature's problem, not yours
- The property that makes it sustainable makes it expensive
- Crossing disciplines means belonging fully to none

# Allow an easement

- Which performance spec comes from a different application entirely?
- What if it doesn't need to match the petroleum-based version?
- The regulatory category was invented for something else
- Let it be worse on one axis to be transformative on another

# Are there sections? Consider transitions

- Where does the implant end and the tissue begin? That zone is the real material
- The interface between bulk and surface is where most failures start
- Map the transitions: synthesis → processing → sterilization → implantation → degradation
- The gradient matters more than the endpoint composition

# Ask people to work against their better judgment

- The polymer chemist says it will degrade too fast — ask them to make it degrade faster
- Force the ceramicist to think about flexibility
- What happens when you ask the biologist to design the material?
- The clinician's instinct to avoid risk is also avoiding the breakthrough

# Ask your body

- Put the prototype in your hand. Does it feel like something you'd let inside you?
- The foreign body response is the body asking a question — what is the answer?
- Inflammation is information, not failure
- What does the material feel like at body temperature, not room temperature?

# Assemble some of the instruments in a group and treat the group

- Combine three weak materials into one composite that does what none could alone
- Treat the scaffold-cell-signal system as one material, not three components
- The coating, substrate, and interface are one design problem
- Blend the processing steps — sintering, coating, and sterilization as a single workflow

# Balance the consistency principle with the inconsistency principle

- Batch-to-batch variation is the enemy of regulation but the friend of discovery
- Nature's materials are consistent in function but inconsistent in microstructure
- Standardize what matters for safety, vary what matters for performance
- The perfectly reproducible material may be perfectly mediocre

# Be dirty

- The trace impurity might be the active ingredient
- Ultra-pure materials don't exist in the body — why do they exist in your lab?
- What if the rough surface is the feature, not the defect?
- Biological systems are messy — a material that demands sterile perfection may be asking the wrong question

# Breathe more deeply

- Step back from the nanoscale. What does this material do at the organ level?
- You've been optimizing one property for months — what system does it serve?
- Read the clinical case reports, not just the materials papers
- The patient's experience of the material is not captured in your characterization data

# Bridges -build -burn

- Build the bridge between synthetic and natural — the hybrid material
- Burn the bridge to the incumbent material — commit to the new platform
- The temporary scaffold is a bridge the body burns on its own schedule
- Connect the chemistry lab to the operating room — or disconnect them entirely

# Cascades

- Degradation is a cascade: hydrolysis → fragment release → pH change → accelerated hydrolysis
- The biological response cascades too: protein adsorption → cell adhesion → inflammation → remodeling
- Design for the cascade, not the single time point
- One surface modification triggers a sequence you didn't plan for — learn from it

# Change instrument roles

- Use the drug delivery system as the structural implant
- The packaging material might be the actual biomaterial
- What if the scaffold's job isn't structure but signaling?
- Let the surface do what you've been asking the bulk to do

# Change nothing and continue with immaculate consistency

- The material works in the lab. Don't reformulate — scale it exactly as it is
- Resist the urge to optimize further; the current version is good enough to test in vivo
- Sometimes the biomaterial is ready; it's the regulatory pathway that needs work
- Consistency of manufacturing is itself a competitive advantage in this field

# Children's voices -speaking -singing

- How would you explain this material to a patient who has to live with it?
- The child asks "what is it made of?" — can you answer simply?
- Naïve questions from outside the field reveal your hidden assumptions
- What would a student try that you've decided is too obvious?

# Cluster analysis

- Group your materials by biological response, not by chemical composition
- Which failed materials cluster together? What do they share?
- The property space has regions you haven't explored — map the gaps
- Cluster the clinical failures — the pattern tells you what the material property data won't

# Consider different fading systems

- Degradation profiles: linear, exponential, staged, triggered — which one matches the biology?
- The material should fade as the tissue strengthens — match the curves
- What if the material doesn't fully disappear but transforms into something the body can use?
- Consider how the material's properties fade, not just its mass

# Consult other sources -promising -unpromising

- The food science literature solved your encapsulation problem years ago
- Promising: tissue engineering journals. Unpromising: geology, textile science, dentistry
- The materials that fail as implants might succeed as wound dressings
- What did the ceramics industry know in 1950 that you're rediscovering now?

# Convert a melodic element into a rhythmic element

- Turn the static scaffold into a dynamic, cyclically loaded structure
- Convert the sustained release into pulsatile delivery
- The continuous coating could be a patterned one — periodicity changes the biology
- Translate spatial variation into temporal variation in degradation

# Courage!

- Submit the material for in vivo testing — you've characterized it enough
- Propose the material no one else will defend at the review meeting
- The gap between lab bench and first-in-human is mostly fear, not science
- Publish the negative result — the field needs to know what doesn't work

# Cut a vital connection

- Remove the crosslinker and see if the hydrogel still holds
- What if you eliminate the surface treatment entirely?
- Cut the connection between the material and the growth factor — does the scaffold work on its own?
- Disconnect the material from the existing clinical indication — what else could it do?

# Decorate, decorate

- Functionalize the surface, then functionalize it again
- Layer bioactive molecules: adhesion peptides, growth factors, antimicrobial agents
- Add complexity until the biology responds — then ask which layer mattered
- The bare titanium surface is a missed opportunity

# Define an area as 'safe' and use it as an anchor

- Lock down the base material — it's biocompatible and processable. Now explore surface modifications
- The FDA-cleared predicate device is your anchor — innovate relative to it
- Establish one property as non-negotiable (e.g., no cytotoxicity) and vary everything else
- Use the well-characterized polymer as your safe platform for risky additives

# Destroy -nothing -the most important thing

- Destroy nothing: the material must survive sterilization, storage, and surgery unchanged
- Destroy the most important thing: remove the property you've been optimizing and see what's left
- What if the material's purpose is to be destroyed by the body — on schedule?
- Ablate the surface layer. What's underneath is the real material

# Discard an axiom

- Discard "biocompatibility means inert" — what if it means actively communicating?
- Discard "stronger is better" — the body doesn't need your material to last forever
- What if degradation products don't need to be non-toxic, just metabolizable?
- Abandon the assumption that the material must mimic the tissue it replaces

# Disconnect from desire

- Stop wanting the material to be the final clinical product and let it be a research tool
- You want it to be biodegradable — but does the application actually need that?
- The desire for a single material that does everything is preventing a good composite
- Disconnect from the desire for novelty — the old material with a new process might be enough

# Discover the recipes you are using and abandon them

- You always start with the same molecular weight. Why?
- The standard protocol has twelve steps — which ones are rituals, not requirements?
- Your favorite solvent, your default cell line, your go-to characterization method — abandon one
- The recipe you inherited from the previous postdoc contains assumptions they never questioned

# Distorting time

- Accelerated degradation testing distorts time — what does it distort about the mechanism?
- The implant lives on a different timescale than the experiment
- Compress the development timeline: what would you skip if you had to implant it next month?
- The material changes over years — your funding cycle is three

# Do nothing for as long as possible

- Don't modify the surface yet. Let the cells tell you what they need
- Incubate longer before measuring — early time points mislead
- Wait for the body to remodel around the implant before judging it
- The urge to add another component is premature. Characterize what you have first

# Don't be afraid of things because they're easy to do

- The simple blend might outperform the elegant copolymer
- Dip-coating is unsophisticated and might be exactly right
- Don't dismiss the material because anyone could make it — that's a feature for scale-up
- The easy synthesis is the one that will actually reach manufacturing

# Don't be frightened of cliches

- Yes, hydroxyapatite again — but have you tried it in this geometry?
- PLGA is a cliché for a reason. Use it as your baseline, not your enemy
- The textbook biomaterial might be the right starting point
- "Biocompatible and biodegradable" is said so often it sounds empty — but it's still the goal

# Don't be frightened to display your talents

- You understand the polymer chemistry better than the biologists — lead with that
- Show the clinician the material, not just the data about the material
- Your processing expertise is unique — don't hide it behind someone else's biology
- The unusual characterization technique you developed is worth publishing on its own

# Don't break the silence

- The material isn't causing inflammation. Don't add immunomodulatory agents
- If the cells are happy on the surface, stop modifying it
- The absence of a host response is itself a design achievement — don't provoke one
- Some biomaterials succeed by doing nothing loudly

# Don't stress one thing more than another

- You're over-indexing on mechanical strength and ignoring degradation kinetics
- The surface chemistry paper got all the citations but the bulk porosity matters just as much
- Don't let the in vitro results dominate — the in vivo environment is different in every way
- Characterize all the properties, not just the one that looks good in a figure

# Do something boring

- Run the standard cytotoxicity assay. You've been avoiding it
- Repeat the synthesis three more times and check reproducibility
- Measure the water contact angle again — the basics still matter
- Do the literature review you skipped when you started the project

# Do the washing up

- Clean the lab. Contamination is the most common source of false results in biomaterials
- Audit your chemical inventory — expired reagents give inconsistent materials
- Update the protocols folder. The method you're using isn't the method you've written down
- Calibrate the instruments before the next experiment, not after the confusing result

# Do the words need changing?

- "Smart material" means nothing specific. What does it actually respond to?
- Is it a scaffold, a matrix, a substrate, or a template? The word shapes the design
- "Biocompatible" — compatible with what, exactly? Which cells, which tissue, which patient?
- Rename the project from the material to the problem it solves

# Do we need holes?

- Porosity is the question every scaffold designer must answer
- The pore you designed for cell infiltration might be too small, too large, or unnecessary
- What if the material doesn't need to be porous — what if degradation creates the space?
- Interconnected pores, closed pores, gradient pores — each is a different material

# Emphasize differences

- What makes your hydrogel different from every other hydrogel? Lead with that
- Emphasize the difference between in vitro and in vivo performance — they're not the same material
- The difference between your material at day 1 and day 30 is the real story
- Contrast the synthetic with the natural — where the differences are is where you learn

# Emphasize repetitions

- The same failure mode in three different compositions — that's a pattern worth studying
- Repeat the experiment. If the result holds, it's real. If not, you saved yourself years
- The body's response to your material repeats across species — what's conserved is fundamental
- Cyclic loading reveals what static testing hides

# Emphasize the flaws

- The crack propagation path tells you about the microstructure
- The region where cells don't adhere is more informative than where they do
- Publish the failure — the material that causes inflammation in a specific way is a finding
- The defect in the crystal structure might be the active site

# Faced with a choice, do both

- Ceramic or polymer? Make the composite
- Degradable or permanent? Design the partially degradable implant
- Surface modification or bulk modification? Do both and see which dominates
- Animal model A or B? Run both — they'll teach you different things

# Feedback recordings into an acoustic situation

- Feed the degradation products back into the synthesis — closed-loop material design
- Use the cell response data to redesign the surface in the next iteration
- The clinical outcome feeds back into the material specification — but the loop takes years
- Let the mechanical testing results directly parameterize the next finite element model

# Fill every beat with something

- Every surface site is either functionalized or it's a missed opportunity
- Load the scaffold with cells, signals, and structure — maximize the design space
- Fill the pore volume with something intentional, not just culture medium
- Every stage of degradation should release something useful

# Get your neck massaged

- Step away from the fume hood. The synthesis will still be there tomorrow
- Conference hallway conversations solve more problems than poster sessions
- Visit the clinic and watch the surgeon use your material — or its competitor
- Talk to the patient who lives with the implant. Then go back to the lab

# Ghost echoes

- The residual monomer haunts the polymer long after synthesis
- Previous surface contamination echoes in the cell response weeks later
- The material remembers its processing history — thermal history, solvent traces, mechanical stress
- The body remembers previous implants — the second material enters a pre-sensitized environment

# Give the game away

- Publish your synthesis protocol in full detail. Let others reproduce it
- Share the failed formulations — they narrow the search space for everyone
- Open-source the material characterization dataset
- Tell the competitor what you tried. The bottleneck isn't the idea — it's the execution

# Give way to your worst impulse

- Use the material everyone says is too toxic — at what concentration does it become safe?
- Try the processing method that's considered too crude for biomedical use
- What if you implanted the material without sterilizing it first? (In silico, of course)
- Add the component your advisor would never approve and see what happens in the dish

# Go slowly all the way round the outside

- Characterize the periphery of the implant site, not just the center
- Map the entire surface, not just the representative area you chose for the SEM image
- Walk through the whole supply chain from raw material to operating room
- Trace the complete degradation pathway — every intermediate, every byproduct

# Honor thy error as a hidden intention

- The batch that came out wrong has unexpected properties — characterize them
- The contaminated sample that performed better — figure out why
- Phase separation was a mistake. Now it's your controlled microstructure
- The animal that rejected the implant fastest showed you the real failure mode

# How would you have done it?

- How would you have designed bone if you started from scratch?
- What material would you choose if you'd never heard of titanium?
- If you were designing this implant for a child, not an adult, what changes?
- How would you approach this problem if polymers didn't exist?

# Humanize something free of error

- The perfectly smooth surface is biologically inert — add deliberate roughness
- Introduce controlled variability into the pore structure — uniformity isn't natural
- The flawless crystal doesn't integrate with tissue the way a rough one does
- Make the material imperfect in the way that biology expects

# Imagine the music as a moving chain or caterpillar

- Think of the material as a dynamic system moving through states: implantation → integration → remodeling → resolution
- The polymer chain itself is moving, folding, relaxing — the material is never static
- Trace the path of a single cell as it encounters, adheres to, and remodels the material
- The supply chain is also a chain — each link constrains the next

# Imagine the music as a set of disconnected events

- Each cell-material interaction is independent — don't assume coordinated behavior
- The implant in the knee and the implant in the spine face unrelated mechanical environments
- Separate the synthesis, the processing, and the sterilization — optimize each on its own terms
- The protein that adsorbs first has nothing to do with the cell that arrives later. Or does it?

# Infinitesimal gradations

- The difference between 49% and 51% crystallinity changes everything
- Tune the degradation rate in increments smaller than your current resolution
- Gradient materials: composition changing continuously from one face to the other
- The therapeutic window is narrow — your material must hit it precisely

# Intentions -credibility of -nobility of -humility of

- Is the intention to help the patient, or to publish in Nature Materials?
- Noble intention: replace the organ. Humble intention: reduce one re-operation
- The credibility of your material rests on the reproducibility of your data
- Are you designing for the best possible outcome or the most likely one?

# Into the impossible

- A material that remodels itself in response to the local biology — impossible, but aim there
- Self-healing structural implants. Living biomaterials. Materials that think
- Aim for the implant that lasts the patient's lifetime. Fifty-year design life
- An off-the-shelf material that adapts to any patient — impossible, but what gets you closest?

# Is it finished?

- The material is characterized. The cells like it. The animal data is promising. Is it finished?
- You'll never have enough data to feel certain — when do you stop optimizing?
- The prototype works in the lab. Is the research finished, or is translation a different project?
- The degradation study has been running for three years. When do you stop measuring?

# Is there something missing?

- You've tested mechanics, degradation, and cytotoxicity — but what about the immune response?
- The material looks great in 2D culture. Have you tested it in 3D?
- Missing from your study: the sterilization step that changes everything
- You characterized the material but not its degradation products

# Is the tuning appropriate?

- Is the stiffness matched to the target tissue? Bone, cartilage, and brain need different things
- The degradation rate is tuned to the in vitro model — is it tuned to the in vivo reality?
- The pore size was optimized for one cell type. Is it appropriate for the cells that actually arrive?
- Your material is tuned for the young, healthy patient. Is that who receives implants?

# Just carry on

- The results are messy. Keep going — biological variability is real
- The review was harsh. The material still has potential. Keep iterating
- Translation takes decades in biomaterials. Just carry on
- The funding gap between basic research and clinical trial is wide. Keep walking

# Left channel, right channel, center channel

- Separate the load-bearing function from the bioactive function from the degradation function
- Design for the cortical bone (hard), cancellous bone (soft), and the interface between them
- In vitro, in vivo, in silico — three channels of evidence that must converge
- The material, the device, and the procedure are three channels that deliver one outcome

# Listen in total darkness, or in a very large room, very quietly

- Remove all the characterization instruments. What can you observe with your eyes and hands?
- Implant the material in the simplest possible model — no growth factors, no co-culture, no mechanical loading
- Test the material in isolation before testing it in the system
- What does the material do when no one is measuring it?

# Listen to the quiet voice

- The minor component at 2% might be driving the biological response
- The technician noticed something odd about the last batch — listen
- The undergrad's question in lab meeting that no one took seriously
- The weak signal in the degradation data at month six — it becomes the dominant signal by month twelve

# Look at a very small object; look at its center

- Zoom into the nanostructure. What does the material look like at 10 nm?
- The center of the scaffold is where cells can't reach — that's your design problem
- Look at a single grain boundary. That's where corrosion starts
- The center of the pore is where the cell must decide: attach or migrate

# Look at the order in which you do things

- You characterize, then sterilize, then implant. But sterilization changes the material you characterized
- You chose the material before defining the clinical need — reverse the order
- The order of surface modification steps matters. Swap two and see what changes
- You're testing biocompatibility last. It should be first

# Look closely at the most embarrassing details and amplify them

- The material swells 15% in aqueous environment — is that actually a drug release mechanism?
- Your yield is 30%. Focus on why 70% fails instead of on the 30% that works
- The surface coating delaminates under physiological conditions — that's the real finding
- The batch you excluded as an outlier — go back and study it

# Lowest common denominator check -single beat -single note -single riff

- Strip the material to its simplest form. One polymer. One molecular weight. No additives
- Test with one cell type, one time point, one metric. Does it pass?
- What is the minimum viable biomaterial? The simplest version that still works
- Reduce to a single property: if the material could only do one thing, what must it be?

# Make a blank valuable by putting it in an exquisite frame

- The unfunctionalized surface becomes valuable in the right clinical context
- Plain PEEK in a beautifully designed implant geometry
- The unmodified material inside a precision delivery device
- An ordinary polymer made extraordinary by its architecture — porosity, alignment, gradient

# Make an exhaustive list of everything you might do and do the last thing on the list

- List every possible surface modification — the last one is the one nobody tries
- Enumerate all candidate polymers. The one at the bottom of the list is the one worth investigating
- What's the least obvious application for your material?
- The last thing on the list is usually the most uncomfortable. That's why it's interesting

# Make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action; incorporate

- Fracture the sample and examine the break surface — it tells you about the internal structure
- Rapidly quench the material from processing temperature. What phases freeze in?
- Subject the implant to the worst-case mechanical event. If it survives, you have confidence. If not, you have information
- Introduce a harsh chemical environment and see which component fails first

# Mechanicalize something idiosyncratic

- Your lab's unique processing quirk — turn it into a reproducible, documented method
- The hand-mixing technique that works only when you do it — instrument it, measure it, automate it
- Convert the art of scaffold fabrication into an engineering specification
- The intuitive material selection process — formalize it into a decision matrix

# Mute and continue

- Remove the bioactive signal and let the scaffold work on geometry alone
- Turn off the drug release. Does the material still have therapeutic value?
- Block one degradation pathway and observe the others
- Silence the inflammatory response with a control — now what is the material doing?

# Only one element of each kind

- One metal, one polymer, one ceramic — constrain the design space by ruling out redundancy
- One processing step, one characterization method, one biological assay — what's essential?
- Only one source of porosity, only one crosslinking mechanism, only one sterilization method
- Simplify until every component has a unique and necessary role

# (Organic) machinery

- The ribosome builds materials with atomic precision — can you approach that?
- Cells are machines that process materials. Design for the machine, not just the output
- Enzyme-responsive materials: let the body's machinery do the work
- The organic and the mechanical aren't opposites — bone is both

# Overtly resist change

- Keep using the same material. Change everything around it
- Refuse to adopt the trendy nanomaterial. Push the conventional material to its limits first
- The material that resists degradation is sometimes exactly what's needed
- Don't change the formulation in response to one bad result. Repeat it first

# Put in earplugs

- Ignore the latest review article. What does your own data say?
- Block out the hype cycle: graphene, metal-organic frameworks, whatever is next
- Stop reading and start making
- The noise in the field is louder than the signal. Focus on your material, your data, your patient

# Remember those quiet evenings

- The slow, methodical material characterization work that nobody cites
- The material that worked reliably for twenty years without a single high-impact paper
- Before high-throughput screening, someone sat with one material and understood it deeply
- The clinical workhorse materials were discovered by people with patience, not urgency

# Remove ambiguities and convert to specifics

- "Biocompatible" → non-cytotoxic to L929 fibroblasts at 24 hours per ISO 10993-5
- "Strong enough" → compressive strength > 150 MPa to match cortical bone
- "Degrades over time" → 50% mass loss in simulated body fluid at 37°C within 12 weeks
- "Porous" → 300 μm average pore diameter, 85% interconnected porosity

# Remove specifics and convert to ambiguities

- Forget the target modulus. What does the tissue need to feel?
- Instead of a specific degradation rate, ask: should it outlast the healing process or not?
- Replace the molecular weight specification with "processable by a typical lab"
- Stop specifying the exact surface chemistry and ask what biological outcome you want

# Repetition is a form of change

- Cyclic loading changes the material — fatigue is not just failure, it's transformation
- Apply the same surface treatment repeatedly. The fifth layer is different from the first
- Repeated sterilization cycles change the polymer every time
- Re-implanting in the same site after removal — the tissue environment has changed

# Reverse

- Start from the clinical outcome and work backward to the material requirement
- Reverse the degradation: what if the material assembles in situ instead of being implanted pre-formed?
- Flip the surface chemistry — cationic instead of anionic, hydrophobic instead of hydrophilic
- Design the removal process first. The implant that's easy to revise is the one surgeons will trust

# Short circuit

- Skip the animal model and go straight to computational prediction. Then validate
- Bypass the traditional polymer synthesis — buy the monomer, print the shape, test the biology
- The shortest path from material to patient: what are you doing that isn't on that path?
- Use the clinical-grade version from day one. Don't develop a research-grade version you'll have to abandon

# Shut the door and listen from outside

- Let someone else present your material data. What do they emphasize?
- Step away from the project for a month. When you return, what looks different?
- Read your own paper as a reviewer. Where are the gaps?
- Give the material to a different lab. Their results will tell you what's real and what's artifact

# Simple subtraction

- Remove one component from the composite. Which one can you lose?
- Subtract the coating. Does the bulk material perform well enough on its own?
- Take away the growth factor. The material should be the therapy, not the carrier
- Reduce the number of processing steps. Each one adds cost and variability

# Spectrum analysis

- Map the full spectrum of mechanical properties across the implant — it's not uniform
- FTIR, Raman, XPS — each technique sees a different aspect of the same surface
- Characterize the full molecular weight distribution, not just the average
- Spectrum of outcomes: from the best-case patient to the worst-case patient. Design for the range

# Take a break

- The reaction needs time to complete. So does your thinking
- Leave the hydrogel swelling overnight. Leave the problem swelling too
- The material is aging in the incubator. Let it. That's data
- You've been working on this formulation for a year. Go to a conference about something else

# Take away the elements in order of apparent non-importance

- Remove the plasticizer. Then the filler. Then the stabilizer. When does the material fail?
- Strip the surface modification layers one at a time. Which one was load-bearing biologically?
- Eliminate each processing step to find which ones are actually necessary
- Remove the least expensive component first. If it still works, your cost just dropped

# Tape your mouth

- Stop defending the material and listen to the clinician's objections
- Don't explain the mechanism. Show the result
- Let the data speak without your interpretation for once
- At the design meeting, let the engineer and the biologist talk. The materials scientist should listen

# The inconsistency principle

- Embrace the variability between batches — it might reveal which property matters
- The inconsistent results across labs tell you the method isn't robust
- Biological inconsistency (patient variability) is not noise — it's the design constraint
- If the material works inconsistently, the mechanism isn't what you think it is

# The tape is now the music

- The processing is the material. The synthesis route defines the structure more than the chemistry does
- The sterilization method has become part of the material — gamma radiation changes it permanently
- The implantation procedure shapes the material in ways the lab never predicted
- The characterization artifact is now the data point you're publishing

# Think of the radio

- What's being broadcast from other fields that you should tune into?
- Biomaterials for veterinary medicine, for agriculture, for space — different frequencies, same physics
- The patient is receiving signals from the material constantly. What message are you sending?
- Think about the material as a communication channel between the surgeon's intention and the body's response

# Tidy up

- Organize the sample library. You have materials from three years ago you've never tested
- Clean up the characterization data — consistent naming, proper metadata, accessible files
- Archive the failed formulations properly. They're negative results, not waste
- Streamline the synthesis to remove unnecessary steps accumulated over iterations

# Trust in the you of now

- Your material intuition is better than it was five years ago. Trust it
- The formulation you would design today is different from the one you started with. Start over
- Your current understanding of the biology is more mature — redesign the material accordingly
- You've learned from every failed experiment. The next design incorporates all of them

# Turn it upside down

- The bottom of the scaffold — the part facing the defect — is where integration matters most
- Flip the hypothesis: the material doesn't promote healing, the body heals despite the material
- What if the surface coating should be on the inside of the pore, not the outside?
- Invert the question: instead of making the material more like tissue, make the tissue more like the material

# Twist the spine

- Apply torsional loading. Most biomaterials are tested in compression and tension — never torsion
- Reorient the fiber alignment by 90 degrees. The mechanical properties and cell behavior will change
- The spine implant exists in a complex loading environment — test it that way
- Twist the research direction. The material you're making for bone might work better in cartilage

# Use an old idea

- Catgut sutures. Plaster of Paris. Gold dental fillings. What did they get right?
- Revisit the biomaterial that was abandoned in the 1980s — maybe the biology has caught up
- Ancient wound dressings: honey, clay, spider silk. There's a reason they worked
- The first-generation hip implant lasted thirty years. What has your material proven?

# Use an unacceptable color

- The brown discoloration is a sign of useful crosslinking
- A bright blue implant. If the surgeon can see it clearly, placement improves
- The material's color after degradation tells you about the chemistry — don't bleach it away
- What if the aesthetic objection is the patient's only objection? Then the material works

# Use fewer notes

- One polymer. One additive. One processing condition. Constrain the design space radically
- Reduce the number of characterization techniques. Which three tell you everything?
- Fewer components means fewer interactions, fewer failure modes, and easier regulatory filing
- The simplest material that meets the specification is the best material

# Use filters

- Filter the candidate materials by processability first, biocompatibility second
- Use the regulatory pathway as a filter — what can actually reach the patient?
- Filter by cost. The material that works but costs $10,000 per gram is an academic exercise
- Screen out materials by their degradation products before testing the material itself

# Use "unqualified" people

- Let the industrial designer shape the implant — they understand form and function differently
- The undergraduate has no preconceptions about what can't be done
- Involve the patient in material selection — they know what matters in their body
- The manufacturing engineer sees problems the research scientist has designed around

# Water

- The material exists in water from the moment it enters the body. Test it wet
- Water uptake changes everything: mechanics, degradation, drug release, cell behavior
- The hydrogel is 95% water. You're designing the 5%
- The humidity during storage, the hydration during implantation, the interstitial fluid forever after

# What are you really thinking about just now? Incorporate

- You're worried about reproducibility — make reproducibility the paper, not a footnote
- The scaling problem is on your mind — design the material for manufacturing, not just discovery
- You're thinking about the patient. Put their experience into the material specification
- The doubt you have about the mechanism — design the experiment to test it directly

# What is the reality of the situation?

- The reality: most biomaterials never reach clinical trial
- The reality: the surgeon has thirty seconds to place your material. Design for that
- The reality: the body is 37°C, pH varies, mechanical loads are unpredictable, and every patient is different
- The reality: your lab-scale process does not translate to manufacturing without redesign

# What mistakes did you make last time?

- Last time you optimized for one property and ignored the trade-off. What broke?
- The previous formulation degraded too fast because you didn't account for autocatalysis
- You chose the wrong animal model. This time, consult the surgeon first
- Last time you didn't characterize the sterilization effect until it was too late

# What would your closest friend do?

- Your collaborator in the clinic would test it on Monday. Your collaborator in chemistry would run another year of studies
- What would the most pragmatic person you know do with this material?
- Ask your closest colleague to honestly evaluate the material — not the science, the material
- What would someone who doesn't need to publish do differently?

# What wouldn't you do?

- You wouldn't use that material in your own body — why are you proposing it for someone else?
- You wouldn't normally combine those two polymers. Try it
- You wouldn't skip the toxicity assay — so why are you delaying it?
- You would never submit this material without the fatigue data. So get the fatigue data

# Work at a different speed

- Slow down the synthesis. Controlled crystallization takes time
- Speed up the characterization — high-throughput screening exists for biomaterials now
- The clinical timeline is years. Your experiments are days. Which is lying to you?
- Work at the speed of the biology, not the speed of the grant cycle

# You are an engineer

- The material must meet a specification, not just be interesting
- Design for manufacturing, sterilization, shelf life, and surgical handling — not just biocompatibility
- Engineering means trade-offs. State yours explicitly
- You are an engineer: the material must work in the patient, not just in the journal

# You can only make one dot at a time

- You can only optimize one property at a time. Choose the most important one for this iteration
- One experiment, one question, one answer. Don't overload the study
- Each batch is one data point. Accept that and plan for many batches
- One material for one application. Don't try to make the universal biomaterial

# You don't have to be ashamed of using your own ideas

- Your proprietary formulation is worth pursuing even if it doesn't cite the big labs
- The modification you invented in your own lab doesn't need validation from a famous group
- Your processing technique is novel. Publish it under your name
- The idea that came from your own clinical observation is as valid as one from the literature

# [blank white card]

- Design a material for an application that doesn't exist yet
- What biomaterial would you make if no regulation existed?
- The body is the blank card — it will write its own response to whatever you implant
- Leave space in the design for what you haven't imagined yet
